# Exam 1 Retrospection

## Quality of participation (Team members completed their tasks within the assignment well)

##### Worked 
Tasks were completed satisfactorily and when things were completed there weren't any issues with the quality of the work. Overall good work on necessary tasks. 

##### Needs Improvement

##### Did Not Work

###### How to fix it

## Quantity of participation (Team members completed their tasks that were their part)

##### Worked 
All team members seemed to complete their given tasks on the project.

##### Needs Improvement 
Better definition of split between certain tasks given. On complex tasks more evenly split workload. Some tasks to complete were harder than others and some people worked on a larger quantity of work because of this (Shoutout to Sam for crushing it on Java)

##### Did Not Work 
I wouldn't say that anything necessarily didn't work, however if we don't address what might need to improve it could lead to team chemistry issues.

###### How to fix it
Set clear goals and guidelines early on what each person should be working on. Make sure the splits seem even or when even splits can't be achieved all parties agree on tasks
 
## Timeliness of participation (Team members completed/helped to complete tasks on time)

##### Worked
The project got completed by the due date of the assignment

##### Needs Improvement
Less backloading on work schedule. Even though deadline was met, procrastination can create uneccessary stress especially on certain group members who have already completed tasks. Being more timely all the way around is a way to ensure no one feels they need to pick up another members slack.

##### Did Not Work
No timeline of project completion especially with extended due dates

###### How to fix it 
Set an early agreed upon timeline with timed milestones that we try and stick to even if the deadline is extended.

## Communication (Team members communicated well about the work being done, and possible delays and challenges)

##### Worked
Each group member was able to be reached when needed, and the team all started off on the same page.

##### Needs Improvement
Communication is very frontloaded and backloaded. Communication was strong when the project was assigned and then again when it was near its end. Better at communicating changes throughout the middle of the timeline.

##### Did Not Work

###### How to fix it 
for multi-week projects with longer timelines, set weeky or bi-weekly checkins and reports so the team can all come together and see where we are at.
